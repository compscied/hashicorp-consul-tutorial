# Hashicorp Consul tutorial

What is consul?

Consul is key/value store framework for distributed services discovery, configuration, failure detection
- Key/Value Storage -Flexible key/value store for dynamic configuration, feature flagging, coordination, leader election and more. Long poll for near-instant notification of configuration changes.
- Service Discovery - Consul makes it simple for services to register themselves and to discover other services via a DNS or HTTP interface. Register external services such as SaaS providers as well.
- Failure Detection - Pairing service discovery with health checking prevents routing requests to unhealthy hosts and enables services to easily provide circuit breakers.
- Multi Datacenter - Consul scales to multiple datacenters out of the box with no complicated configuration. Look up services in other datacenters, or keep the request local.
